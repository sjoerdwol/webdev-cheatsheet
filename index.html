                    <div class="content">
                        <p> To start a new HTML file, you need to create an .html file in your working directory.<br>
                            It's recommended to name your starting page 'index.html'.<br />
                            In said HTML file, you need to insert the following HTML tags in this order: <br>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;, &lt;html&gt; (opening and closing tag), 
                            &lt;head&gt; (opening and closing tag) and &lt;body&gt; (opening and closing tag).<br> 
                            In the end, your final HTML "skeleton" should look like this:<br><br>
                        </p> 
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                                &lt;html&gt;
                                &lt;head&gt;
                                &lt;/head&gt;
                                &lt;body&gt;
                                &lt;/body&gt;
                                &lt;/html&gt;

                    <div class="content">
                        <p> <strong>The &lt;p&gt; tag</strong> defines a paragraph of text. It's a block element. 
                            Inside it, we can add any inline element we like, like &lt;span&gt; or &lt;a&gt;, but no block elements.<br>
                            By default, browsers style a paragraph with a margin on top and at the bottom.<br> 
                            This causes two consecutive paragraphs to be spaced, replicating what we think of a “paragraph” in printed text.<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>The &lt;span&gt; tag</strong> tag is an inline tag that can be used to create a section in a paragraph that can be targeted using CSS.<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>The &lt;blockquote&gt; HTML tag</strong> is useful to insert citations in the text. Browsers by default apply a margin to the blockquote element.<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>The &lt;code&gt; tag</strong> is especially useful to show code, because browsers give it a monospaced font.<br>
                            This tag is typically wrapped in a pre tag, because the code element ignores whitespace and line breaks.<br>

                            The purpose of a <strong>form</strong> is to allow users to input information and send it.<br>
                            The <strong>form</strong>’s <strong>action</strong> attribute determines where the form’s information goes.<br>
                            The <strong>form</strong>’s <strong>method</strong> attribute determines how the information is sent and processed.<br>
                            To add fields for users to input information we use the <strong>input</strong> element and set the <strong>type</strong> attribute to a field of our choosing.<br>
                            Setting <strong>type</strong> to <strong>"text"</strong> creates a single row field for text input.<br>
                            Setting <strong>type</strong> to <strong>"password"</strong> creates a single row field that censors text input.<br>
                            Setting <strong>type</strong> to <strong>"number"</strong> creates a single row field for number input.<br>
                            Setting <strong>type</strong> to <strong>"range"</strong> creates a slider to select from a range of numbers.<br>
                            Setting <strong>type</strong> to <strong>"checkbox"</strong> creates a single checkbox that can be paired with other checkboxes.<br>
                            Setting <strong>type</strong> to <strong>"radio"</strong> creates a radio button that can be paired with other radio buttons.<br>
                            Setting <strong>type</strong> to <strong>"text"</strong> and adding the <strong>list</strong> attribute will pair the <strong>input</strong> with a <strong>datalist</strong> 
                            element if the <strong>list</strong> of <strong>input</strong> and the <strong>id</strong> of <strong>datalist</strong> are the same.<br>
                            Setting <strong>type</strong> to <strong>"submit"</strong> creates a submit button.<br>
                            A <strong>select</strong> element is populated with <strong>option</strong> elements and renders a dropdown list selection.<br>
                            A <strong>datalist</strong> element is populated with <strong>option</strong> elements and works with an <strong>input</strong> to search through choices.<br>
                            When a <strong>form</strong> is submitted, the <strong>name</strong> of the fields that accept input and the <strong>value</strong> of those fields are sent as <strong>name=value</strong> pairs.

                            Client-side validations happen in the browser before information is sent to a server.<br>
                            Adding the <strong>required</strong> attribute to an input related element will validate that the input field has information in it.<br>
                            Assigning a value to the <strong>min</strong> attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable minimum value.<br>
                            Assigning a value to the <strong>max</strong> attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable maximum value.<br>
                            Assigning a value to the <strong>minlength</strong> attribute of a text input element will validate an acceptable minimum number of characters.<br>
                            Assigning a value to the <strong>maxlength</strong> attribute of a text input element will validate an acceptable maximum number of characters.<br>
                            Assigning a regex to <strong>pattern</strong> matches the input to the provided regex.<br>
                            If validations on a <strong>form</strong> do not pass, the user gets a message explaining why and the <strong>form</strong> cannot be submitted.

                    <div class="content">
                        <p> CSS works with selectors, which work with "priorities". <br />
                            The first selector refers to HTML tags. For example to style a &lt;div&gt; you type 'div {}'' into the CSS file.<br />
                            The second selectors selects classes in your HTML file. To style &lt;div class="test"&gt; you type '.test {}' into your CSS file.<br />
                            The final selector selects your HTML objects by ID. If you'd like to style &lt;div id="testid"&gt; you need to add '#testid {}' into your CSS file.<br />
                            The priority of the selectors is HTML Tag &lt; Class &lt; ID. <br>A declaration in an ID selector overrides a declaration in a class selector. 
                            Both override declarations of Tag selectors.

                            The property <strong>background-color</strong> sets the color of the background, while <strong>color</strong> sets the the text-color.<br>
                            With <strong>background-image</strong> you can set the background of an element to an image.<br>
                            <br>
                            With <strong>font-family</strong>, you define the typeface of an element. <br>
                            <strong>Font-size</strong> and <strong>font-weight</strong> control the size of and how thin or thick the displayed text is.<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Opacity</strong> can make an element transparent.<br>

                            The <strong>line-height</strong> property modifies the vertical spacing between lines of text.<br>
                            The <strong>letter-spacing</strong> property changes how far apart individual letters are.<br>
                            The <strong>text-align</strong> property places text in the left, right, or center of its parent container.<br>
                            The <strong>word-spacing</strong> property changes how far apart individual words are.

                            The position of an element can be modified with the <strong>position</strong> property.<br>
                            When set to <strong>relative</strong>, an element's position is relative to its default position on the page.<br>
                            When set to <strong>absolute</strong>, an element's position is relative to its closest positioned parent element.<br>
                            It can be pinned to any part of the web page, but the element will still move with the rest of the document when the page is scrolled.<br>
                            When set to <strong>fixed</strong>, an element's position can be pinned to any part of the web page. The element will remain in view no matter what.<br>
                            When set to <strong>sticky</strong>, an element can stick to a defined offset position when the user scrolls its parent container.<br>
                            <br>
                            The <strong>z-index</strong> of an element specifies how far back or how far forward an element appears on the page when it overlaps other elements.<br>
                            <br>
                            The <strong>display</strong> property allows you to control how an element flows vertically and horizontally in a document.<br>
                            When set to <strong>inline</strong>, elements take up as little space as possible, and they cannot have manually adjusted width or height.<br>
                            When set to <strong>block</strong>, elements take up the width of their container and can have manually adjusted heights.<br>
                            When set to <strong>inline-block</strong>, elements can have set width and height, but they can also appear next to each other and do not take up their entire container width.<br>
                            <br>
                            The <strong>float</strong> property moves elements as far left or right as possible on a web page.<br>
                            <br>
                            The <strong>clear</strong> property clears the left or right side (or both) of an element.<br>

                        <p>
                            With the <strong>cursor</strong> property, you can set the cursor to e. g. 'Pointer'.<br>
                            <br>
                            In addition to styling elements themselves, other signifiers and visual feedback can be utilized during user interaction.<br>
                            For this, the pseudo-classes <strong>:link</strong>, <strong>:visited</strong>, <strong>:hover</strong> and <strong>:active</strong> can be used.<br>
                            <strong>:link</strong> basically has the same meaning as the selector without this pseudo-class. <br>
                            <strong>:visited</strong> styles the link after it already has been clicked. <br>
                            <strong>:hover</strong> adjusts the style while the mouse is hovering over the element in question. <br>
                            <strong>:active</strong> adjusts the style while the element is active, e. g. being clicked.<br>
                            The ordering of link state pseudo-class rules is important to reveal the proper information.

                            By adding breadcrumb navigation to a site, users can get a quick feel for where they are on a site. It also hints at the breadth of the site.<br>
                            Breadcrumbs are usually displayed as a horizontal list of pages and take up minimal space.<br>
                            Users expect to find them in the header, left-aligned, and below any primary navigation. Typically they are separated with a '>' or a '/' symbol.<br>
                            <br>
                            Through some tricks with ::before and ::after, you can e. g. design your breadcrumbs as arrows.

                    <h3 class="article_title">Layout with Flexbox</h3>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            There are two important components to a flexbox layout: flex containers and flex items.<br> 
                            A flex container is an element on a page that contains flex items. All direct child elements of a flex container are flex items.<br> 
                            This distinction is important because some of the properties apply to flex containers while others apply to flex items.<br>
                            <br>
                            The following properties can all be set on a flex-container:<br>
                            When the <strong>display</strong> property is set to 'flex', it changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it.<br>
                            When the <strong>display</strong> property is set to 'inline-flex', it allows multiple flex containers to appear inline with each other.<br>
                            The <strong>justify-content</strong> property is used to space items along the main axis (mostly left to right).<br>
                            The <strong>align-items</strong> property is used to space items along the cross axis (mostly top to bottom).<br>
                            The <strong>flex-wrap</strong> specifies that elements should shift along the cross axis if the flex container is not large enough.<br>
                            The <strong>align-content</strong> property is used to space rows along the cross axis.<br>
                            The <strong>flex-direction</strong> property is used to specify the main and cross axes.<br>
                            The <strong>flex-flow</strong> property is used to specify flex-wrap and flex-direction in one declaration.<br>
                            <br>
                            The following properties can all be set on a flex-item:<br>
                            The <strong>flex-grow</strong> property is used to specify how much space (and in what proportions) flex items absorb along the main axis.<br>
                            The <strong>flex-shrink</strong> property is used to specify how much flex items shrink and in what proportions along the main axis.<br>
                            The <strong>flex-basis</strong> property is used to specify the initial size of an element styled with flex-grow and/or flex-shrink.<br>
                            The <strong>flex</strong> property is used to specify flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis in one declaration.

                            CSS Grid can be used to layout entire web pages. <br>
                            Whereas Flexbox is mostly useful for positioning items in a one-dimensional layout, CSS grid is most useful for two-dimensional layouts, <br>
                            providing many tools for aligning and moving elements across both rows and columns.<br>
                            <br>
                            The following properties can all be set on a grid-container:<br>
                            The <strong>grid-template-columns</strong> property defines the number and sizes of the columns of the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-template-rows</strong> property defines the number and sizes of the rows of the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-template</strong> property  is a shorthand for defining both grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns in one line. Format: rows / columns.<br>
                            The <strong>row-gap</strong> property puts blank space between the rows of the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>column-gap</strong> property puts blank space between the columns of the grid.<br><br>
                            The <strong>gap</strong> property is a shorthand for defining both row-gap and column-gap in one line. Format: row-gap column-gap.<br>
                            <br>
                            The following properties can all be set on a grid-item:<br>
                            The <strong>grid-row-start</strong> and <strong>grid-row-end</strong> properties make elements span certain rows of the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-column-start</strong> and <strong>grid-column-end</strong> properties make elements span certain columns of the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-area</strong> property is a shorthand for grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, and grid-column-end in one line. Format: row-start / column-start / row-end / column-end.

                            There are following additional properties that you can use to harness the power of CSS Grid Layout:<br>
                            <br>
                            The following properties can all be set on a grid-container:<br>
                            The <strong>grid-template-areas</strong> property specifies grid named grid areas.<br>
                            The <strong>justify-items</strong> property specifies how grid-items should spread inside their column from left to right.<br>
                            The <strong>justify-content</strong> property specifies how the columns should spread inside their container from left to right.<br>
                            The <strong>align-items</strong> property specifies how grid-items should spread inside their row from top to bottom.<br>
                            The <strong>align-content</strong> property specifies how the rows should spread inside their container from top to bottom.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-auto-rows</strong> property specifies the height of rows added implicitly to the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-auto-columns</strong> property specifies the width of columns added implicitly to the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-auto-flow</strong> property specifies in which direction implicit elements should be created.<br>
                            <br>
                            The following properties can all be set on a flex-item:<br>
                            The <strong>justify-self</strong> property specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the row axis and overrides justify-items.<br>
                            The <strong>align-self</strong> property specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the column axis and overrides align-items.

                            Incorporating relative sizing starts by using units other than pixels. Following properties can be used:<br>
                            <br>
                            The <strong>em</strong> property represents the font-size of the elements relative to the font-size of the parent element.<br>
                            The <strong>rem</strong> property represents the font-size of the elements relative to the font-size of the root element.<br>
                            The <strong>min-width</strong> property ensures a minimum width for an element.<br>
                            The <strong>max-width</strong> property ensures a maximum width for an element.<br>
                            The <strong>min-height</strong> property ensures a minimum height for an element.<br>
                            The <strong>max-height</strong> property ensures a maximum height for an element.<br>
                            <br>
                            To responsivly scale videos and images, the following properties can be used:<br>
                            The <strong>overflow</strong> property with value <strong>hidden</strong> defines that media will be cut, if it's larger than its container.<br>
                            To then adjust the media to the container, you should set <strong>max-width</strong> to <strong>100%</strong>, <strong>height</strong> to <strong>auto</strong> and <strong>display</strong> to <strong>block</strong>.

                            You can write media queries to help with different screen sizes.<br>
                            For media queries to work for mobile devices, you need to set the following tag in your HTML file: <br>
                            meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/<br>
                            <br>
                            Media queries require media features. Media features are the conditions that must be met to render the CSS within a media query.<br>
                            Media features can detect many aspects of a user’s browser, including the screen’s width, height, resolution, orientation, and more.<br>
                            The and operator requires multiple media features to be true at once. <br>
                            A comma separated list of media features only requires one media feature to be true for the code within to be applied.<br>
                            The best practice for identifying where media queries should be set is by resizing the browser to determine where the content naturally breaks.<br>
                            Natural breakpoints are found by resizing the browser.

                            CSS Transitions are a powerful tool for providing visual feedback to users.<br>
                            CSS Transitions have 4 components: <br>
                            A property that will transition.<br>
                            The duration which describes how long the transition takes.<br>
                            The timing function that describes the transition’s acceleration.<br>
                            The delay to pause before the transition will take place.<br>
                            Many properties’ state changes can be transitioned, including color, background color, font size, width, and height. <br>
                            <strong>all</strong> is also a valid transition property that causes every changing property to transition.<br>
                            The shorthand property <strong>transition</strong> can be used to describe all four components of a transition at once.<br>
                            By using the comma (,) operator, many transitions can be described in one CSS rule.

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            CSS animations are made up of two basic building blocks: Keyframes and Animation Properties.<br>
                            Keyframes are the foundation of CSS animations. They define what the animation looks like at each stage of the animation timeline.<br>
                            Each @keyframes is composed of:<br>
                            Name of the animation: A name that describes the animation, for example, "bounceIn".<br>
                            Stages of the animation: Each stage of the animation is represented as a percentage.<br>
                            0% represents the beginning state of the animation. 100% represents the ending state of the animation. Multiple intermediate states can be added in between.<br>
                            CSS Properties: The CSS properties defined for each stage of the animation timeline.<br>
                            <br>
                            Once the @keyframes are defined, the animation properties must be added in order for your animation to function.<br>
                            Animation properties do two things:<br>
                            They assign the @keyframes to the elements that you want to animate.<br>
                            They define how it is animated.<br>
                            The animation properties are added to the CSS selectors that you want to animate. You must add the following two animation properties for the animation to take effect:<br>
                            animation-name: The name of the animation, defined in the @keyframes.<br>
                            animation-duration: The duration of the animation, in seconds (e.g., 5s) or milliseconds (e.g., 200ms).<br>
                            Each animation property can be defined individually, but for cleaner and faster code, it’s recommended that you use the animation shorthand.<br>
                            All the animation properties are added to the same animation property.

                            The <strong>script</strong> element has an opening and closing tag. You can embed JavaScript code inbetween the opening and closing <strong>script</strong> tags.<br>
                            You link to external JavaScript files with the src attribute in the opening <strong>script</strong> tag.<br>
                            By default, scripts are loaded and executed as soon as the HTML parser encounters them in the HTML file.<br>
                            The HTML parser waits to load the entire script before from proceeding to parse the rest of the page elements.<br>
                            The <strong>defer</strong> attribute ensures that the entire HTML file has been parsed before the script is executed.<br>
                            The <strong>async</strong> attribute will allow the HTML parser to continue parsing as the script is being downloaded, but will execute immediately after it has been downloaded.

                        <p>
                            We learned the following on variables:<br>
                            Variables hold reusable data in a program and associate it with a name.<br>
                            The <strong>var</strong> keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS.<br>
                            <strong>let</strong> is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned, and <strong>const</strong> is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value.<br>
                            Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type <strong>undefined</strong>.<br>
                            Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.<br>
                            The <strong>+</strong> operator is used to concatenate strings including string values held in variables.<br>
                            In ES6, template literals use backticks <strong>`</strong> and <strong>${}</strong> to interpolate values into a string.<br>
                            The <strong>typeof</strong> keyword returns the data type (as a string) of a value.

                        <p>
                            An <strong>if</strong> checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to <strong>true</strong>.<br>
                            <strong>if...else</strong> statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.<br>
                            We can add more conditions using <strong>else if</strong> statements.<br>
                            Comparison operators, including <strong><</strong>, <strong>></strong>, <strong><=</strong>, <strong>>=</strong>, <strong>===</strong> and <strong>!==</strong> can compare to values.<br>
                            The logical "and" operator, <strong>&&</strong>, checks if both provided expressions are truthy.<br>
                            The logical "or" operator, <strong>||</strong>, checks if either provided expression is truthy.<br>
                            The bang operator, <strong>!</strong>, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.<br>
                            The ternary operator, <strong>?</strong>, is shorthand to simplify concise <strong>if...else</strong> statements.<br>
                            A <strong>switch</strong> statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple <strong>else if</strong> statements. <br>
                            The <strong>break</strong> keyword stops the remaining <strong>cases</strong> from being checked and executed in a <strong>switch</strong> statement.

                            A <strong>function</strong> is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.<br>
                            A <strong>function</strong> declaration: function greetWorld(){} <br>
                            A parameter is a named variable inside a function’s block which will be assigned the value of the argument passed in when the function is invoked.<br>
                            To call a funtion in your code: greetWorld(); <br>
                            ES6 introduces new ways of handling arbitrary parameters through default parameters which allow us to assign a default value to a parameter in case no argument is passed into the function.<br>
                            To return a value from a function, we use a <strong>return</strong> statement.<br>
                            To define a function using <strong>function expressions</strong>: const calculateArea = function(){};<br>
                            To define a function using <strong>arrow function notation</strong>: const calculateArea = () => {};<br>

                            <strong>Scope</strong> refers to where variables can be accessed throughout the program, and is determined by where and how they are declared.<br>
                            <strong>Blocks</strong> are statements that exist within curly braces <strong>{}</strong>.<br>
                            <strong>Global scope</strong> refers to the context within which variables are accessible to every part of the program.<br>
                            <strong>Global variables</strong> are variables that exist within global scope.<br>
                            <strong>Block scope</strong> refers to the context within which variables are accessible only within the block they are defined.<br>
                            <strong>Local variables</strong> are variables that exist within block scope.<br>
                            <strong>Global namespace</strong> is the space in our code that contains globally scoped information.<br>
                            <strong>Scope pollution</strong> is when too many variables exist in a namespace or variable names are reused.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Arrays</strong> are lists that store data in JavaScript.<br>
                            <strong>Arrays</strong> are created with brackets <strong>[]</strong>.<br>
                            Each item inside of an array is at a numbered position, or index, starting at <strong>0</strong>.<br>
                            We can access one item in an array using its index, with syntax like <strong>myArray[0]</strong>.<br>
                            We can also change an item in an array using its index, with syntax like <strong>myArray[0] = 'new string'</strong>.<br>
                            Arrays have a <strong>length</strong> property, which allows you to see how many items are in an array.<br>
                            Arrays have their own methods, including <strong>.push()</strong> and <strong>.pop()</strong>, which add and remove items from an array, respectively.<br>
                            Arrays have many methods that perform different tasks, such as <strong>.slice()</strong> and <strong>.shift()</strong>.<br>
                            Some built-in methods are mutating, meaning the method will change the array, while others are not mutating. You can always check the documentation.<br>
                            Variables that contain arrays can be declared with <strong>let</strong> or <strong>const</strong>. Even when declared with <strong>const</strong>, arrays are still mutable. However, a variable declared with <strong>const</strong> cannot be reassigned.<br>
                            Arrays mutated inside of a function will keep that change even outside the function.<br>
                            Arrays can be nested inside other arrays.<br>
                            To access elements in nested arrays chain indices using bracket notation.

                            Loops perform repetitive actions so we don’t have to code that process manually every time.<br>
                            A <strong>for</strong> loop loops for an specific amount of time.<br>
                            A nested <strong>for</strong> loop is a loop inside another loop.<br>
                            <strong>while</strong> loops allow for different types of stopping conditions.<br>
                            Stopping conditions are crucial for avoiding infinite loops.<br>
                            <strong>do...while</strong> a loops run code at least once— only checking the stopping condition after the first execution.<br>
                            The <strong>break</strong> keyword allows programs to leave a loop during the execution of its block.

                            Objects store collections of key-value pairs.<br>
                            Each key-value pair is a property—when a property is a function it is known as a method.<br>
                            An object literal is composed of comma-separated key-value pairs surrounded by curly braces.<br>
                            You can access, add or edit a property within an object by using dot notation or bracket notation.<br>
                            We can add methods to our object literals using key-value syntax with anonymous function expressions as values or by using the new ES6 method syntax.<br>
                            We can navigate complex, nested objects by chaining operators.<br>
                            Objects are mutable—we can change their properties even when they’re declared with <strong>const</strong>.<br>
                            Objects are passed by reference— when we make changes to an object passed into a function, those changes are permanent.<br>
                            We can iterate through objects using the <strong>for...in</strong> syntax.

                            The object that a method belongs to is called the calling object.<br>
                            The <strong>this</strong> keyword refers to the calling object and can be used to access properties of the calling object.<br>
                            Methods do not automatically have access to other internal properties of the calling object.<br>
                            The value of <strong>this</strong> depends on where the <strong>this</strong> is being accessed from.<br>
                            We cannot use arrow functions as methods if we want to access other internal properties.<br>
                            JavaScript objects do not have built-in privacy, rather there are conventions to follow to notify other developers about the intent of the code.<br>
                            The usage of an underscore before a property name means that the original developer did not intend for that property to be directly changed.<br>
                            Setters and getter methods allow for more detailed ways of accessing and assigning properties.<br>
                            Factory functions allow us to create object instances quickly and repeatedly.<br>
                            There are different ways to use object destructuring: one way is the property value shorthand and another is destructured assignment.<br>

                            <strong>.forEach()</strong> is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns <strong>undefined</strong>.<br>
                            <strong>.map()</strong> executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.<br>
                            <strong>.filter()</strong> checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.<br>
                            <strong>.findIndex()</strong> returns the index of the first element of an array that satisfies a condition in the callback function. It returns <strong>-1</strong> if none of the elements in the array satisfies the condition.<br>
                            <strong>.reduce()</strong> iterates through an array and takes the values of the elements and returns a single value.<br>
                            All iterator methods take a callback function, which can be a pre-defined function, a function expression, or an arrow function.

                            The <strong>document</strong> keyword grants access to the root of the DOM in JavaScript.<br>
                            The DOM Interface allows you to select a specific element with CSS selectors by using the <strong>.querySelector()</strong> method.<br>
                            You can access an element directly by its ID with the <strong>.getElementById()</strong> method which returns a single element.<br>
                            You can access an array of elements with <strong>.getElementsByClassName()</strong> and <strong>.getElementsByTagName()</strong>, then call a single element by referencing its placement in the array.<br>
                            The <strong>.innerHTML</strong> and <strong>.style</strong> properties allow you to modify an element by changing its contents or style respectively.<br>
                            You can create, append, and remove elements by using the <strong>.createElement()</strong>, <strong>.appendChild()</strong> and <strong>.removeChild()</strong> methods respectively.<br>
                            The <strong>.onclick</strong> property can add interactivity to a DOM element based on a click event.<br>
                            The <strong>.children</strong> property returns a list of an element’s children and the <strong>.parentNode</strong> property returns the element’s closest connected node in the direction towards the root.

                            You can register events to DOM elements using the <strong>addEventListener()</strong> method.<br>
                            The <strong>addEventListener()</strong> method takes to arguments: an event type and an event handler function.<br>
                            When an event is triggered on the event target, the registered event handler function executes.<br>
                            Event handler functions can also be registered as values of <strong>onevent</strong> properties of their event target.<br>
                            Event object properties like <strong>.target</strong>, <strong>.type</strong>, and <strong>.timeStamp</strong> are used to provide information about the event.<br>
                            The <strong>addEventListener()</strong> method can be used to add multiple event handler functions to a single event.<br>
                            The <strong>removeEventListener()</strong> method stops specific event handlers from “listening” for specific events firing.

                            <strong>Inheritance</strong> is when we create a parent class with properties and methods that we can extend to child classes.<br>
                            We use the <strong>extends</strong> keyword to create a subclass.<br>
                            The <strong>super</strong> keyword calls the <strong>constructor()</strong> of a parent class.<br>
                            Static methods are called on the class, but not on instances of the class.

                            <strong>Modules</strong> are reusable pieces of code in a file that can be exported and then imported for use in another file.<br>
                            This modular strategy is sometimes called <em>separation of concerns</em> and is useful for debugging, reusing code and keeping information private.<br>
                            <strong>Modules</strong> are implemented using the <strong>export</strong> and <strong>import</strong> keywords.

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Promises</strong> are JavaScript objects that represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.<br>
                            <strong>Promises</strong> can be in one of three states: <em>pending</em>, <em>resolved</em>, or <em>rejected</em>.<br>
                            We construct a promise by using the <strong>new</strong> keyword and passing an executor function to the <strong>Promises</strong> constructor method.<br>
                            <strong>setTimeout()</strong> is a Node function which delays the execution of a callback function using the event-loop.<br>
                            We use <strong>.then()</strong> with a success handler callback containing the logic for what should happen if a promise resolves.<br>
                            We use <strong>.catch()</strong> with a failure handler callback containing the logic for what should happen if a promise rejects.<br>
                            <strong>Promise</strong> composition enables us to write complex, asynchronous code that’s still readable. We do this by chaining multiple <strong>.then()'s</strong> and <strong>.catch's</strong>.<br>
                            To use <strong>Promise</strong> composition correctly, we have to remember to return <strong>Promises</strong> constructed within a <strong>.then()</strong>.<br>
                            We should chain multiple <strong>Promises</strong> rather than nesting them.<br>
                            To take advantage of concurrency, we can use <strong>Promise.all()</strong>.

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            <strong>async...await</strong> is syntactic sugar built on native JavaScript promises and generators.<br>
                            We declare an async function with the keyword <strong>async</strong>.<br>
                            Inside an <strong>async</strong> function we use the <strong>await</strong> operator to pause execution of our function until an asynchronous action completes and the awaited promise is no longer pending.<br>
                            <strong>await</strong> returns the resolved value of the awaited promise.<br>
                            We can write multiple <strong>await</strong> statements to produce code that reads like synchronous code.<br>
                            We use <strong>try...catch</strong> statements within our async functions for error handling.<br>
                            We should still take advantage of concurrency by writing <strong>async</strong> functions that allow asynchronous actions to happen in concurrently whenever possible.

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            <strong>JSX</strong> is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It looks a lot like HTML<br/>
                            <strong>JSX</strong> is not valid JavaScript. Web browsers can't read it.<br/>
                            If a JavaScript file contains <strong>JSX</strong> code, then that file has to be compiled before reaching the browser.<br/>
                            A basic unit of <strong>JSX</strong> could look like this: <strong>const helloWorld = &lt;h1&gt;Hello world&lt;/h1&gt;</strong>.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            <strong>JSX</strong> can be saved in a variable, stored in an object or array or be passed to a function.<br/>
                            <strong>JSX</strong> elements also can have attributes, just like regular HTML elements.<br/>
                            <strong>JSX</strong> elements can be nested inside of other <strong>JSX</strong> elements. To improve readability, HTML-style line breaks and indentation can be used.<br/>
                            In this case, the multi-line <strong>JSX</strong> expression has to be wrapped in <strong>parentheses ()</strong>.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            <strong>JSX</strong> must have exactly one outermost element. The first opening tag and the final closing tag must belong to the same element.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            <strong>JSX</strong> elements are rendered by the <strong>ReactDOM.render()</strong> function.<br/>
                            The <strong>JSX</strong> element, which has to be rendered, gets passed as the first argument, while the location gets passed as the second argument.

                    <h3 class="article_title">More advanced JSX</h3>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            Grammar in <strong>JSX</strong> is mostly the same as in HTML.<br/>
                            One difference is the class-attribute. Since class is a reserved word in JavaScript, you have to use the className-attribute in <strong>JSX</strong> instead.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Another difference are self-closing tags.<br/>
                            While the forward-slash before the closing angle-bracket is optional in JavaScript, it is mandatory in <strong>JSX</strong>.<br/>
                            So &lt;br&gt; in JavaScript would have to be &lt;br/&gt; in <strong>JSX</strong>. Same goes for e. g. images.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            We can include plain JavaScript in <strong>JSX</strong> expressions. For this we use <strong>curly braces {}</strong>.<br/>
                            So e. g. <strong>{2+3}</strong> inside an <strong>JSX</strong> expression would print 5, since the 2+3 would be executed.<br/>
                            We can include JavaScript variables in our <strong>JSX</strong> expressions in the same way. This is also how event listeners can be assigned to <strong>JSX</strong> elements.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            If-Statements inside <strong>JSX</strong> expressions themselves don't work. Instead, there are multiple options on how to include conditionals.<br/>
                            The first option is to write an if statement outside of the <strong>JSX</strong> expression and include the result in the <strong>JSX</strong> expression.<br/>
                            Secondly, you can use the ternary operator inside the <strong>JSX</strong> expression <strong>( x ? y : z)</strong>.<br/> 
                            Lastly, you can use the <strong>&&</strong> operator. If the statement on the left results in true, the <strong>JSX</strong> expression on the right gets rendered.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            The <strong>.map()</strong> function is one, that gets used often in React. It can be used to e. g. transform an array of elements to <strong>JSX</strong> expressions.<br/>
                            It also allows you to easily assign the <strong>key</strong>-attribute to list items. The key is not always necessary in <strong>JSX</strong>, but it never hurts to use them!

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            A <strong>component</strong> is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job. That job is oftne to render some HTML.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            One way to define a new React <strong>component</strong> is by using JavaScript classes, called <strong>class components</strong>.<br/>
                            A <strong>component class</strong> has to subclass the <strong>Component class</strong> from the React library (<strong>React.Component</strong>).<br/>
                            The name of a <strong>component class</strong> has to begin with a capital letter and should be written in <em>UpperCamelCase</em>.<br/>
                            Also, each <strong>component class</strong> has to atleast have a <strong>render()</strong> function which atleast returns an <strong>JSX</strong> expression.<br/>
                            A <strong>component instance</strong> can be rendered by using the <strong>ReactDOM.render()</strong> function and using the <strong>component class</strong> as first argument.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            More advanced <strong>JSX</strong> concepts like multi-line <strong>JSX</strong> or variable attributes can also be used in <strong>components</strong>.<br/>
                            <strong>Components</strong> can also include more logic then just returning an <strong>JSX</strong> expression.<br/> 
                            This can either be implemented in the <strong>render()</strong> function or in other functions. These other functions can then e. g. be used as event listeners for an <strong>JSX</strong> expression.

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Components</strong> are able render other <strong>components</strong>.<br/>
                            For this, the main <strong>component</strong> has to import the other <strong>component</strong>, which thus has to be exported.<br/>
                            After the succesful export-import, the imported <strong>component</strong> can be rendered by being instanceiated in the <strong>render()</strong> function of the main <strong>component</strong>.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            <strong>Props</strong> are the way for <strong>component</strong> to communicate with each other.<br/>
                            <strong>Props</strong> can be passed by assigning attributes to the instances of other <strong>component</strong>. The attribute has to follow the syntax: <em>prop-name=value</em>.<br/>
                            The receiving <strong>component</strong> can access the passed prop with <em>this.props.prop-name</em>.<br/>
                            The received <strong>prop</strong> can then be used for multiple purposes. It can be displayed, used for decisions or used to pass event handlers.<br/>
                            A specific <strong>prop</strong> is <strong>this.props.children</strong>. It contains all children elements between the opening and closing tag of instanceiated <strong>component</strong>.<br/>
                            In each file, outside of the <strong>component class</strong>, you can declare default <strong>props</strong>. These default <strong>props</strong> will be used, if a <strong>component</strong> expects a <strong>prop</strong>, but doesn't receive one.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            <strong>State</strong> is a <strong>component's</strong> own way of handling dynamic information. Other than <strong>props</strong>, the <strong>state</strong> can not be influenced from the outside.<br/>
                            The initial <strong>state</strong> is set in the constructor of the <strong>component</strong>. <em>this.state</em> expects an object, which can include multiple <strong>key:value</strong> pairs.<br/>
                            The <strong>state</strong> can be accessed by calling <strong>this.state.key</strong>.<br/>
                            Later, the <strong>state</strong> can be updated by using <strong>this.setState()</strong>. This merges the object in the <strong>setState</strong> with the existing <strong>state</strong> from the constructor.<br/>
                            <strong>this.setState</strong> most commonly gets wrapped in a custom function. For this to work, the custom function has to be binded to <strong>this</strong> in the constructor.<br/>
                            <strong>this.setState</strong> automatically calls the <strong>render()</strong> function after changing the <strong>state</strong>.

                            <strong>Components</strong> that have a <strong>state</strong> are called <strong>stateful</strong>, while <strong>components</strong> without one are <strong>stateless</strong>.<br/>
                            One of the many <strong>React Programming Patterns</strong> includes one <strong>stateful Parent Component</strong> and two <strong>stateless Child Components</strong>.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            The first <strong>stateless Child Component</strong> is tasked with displaying the current <strong>state</strong> of the <strong>stateful Parent Component</strong>.<br/>
                            For this, the <strong>state</strong> gets passed down to the <strong>Child Component</strong> as a <strong>prop</strong>. Said <strong>Child</strong> then uses the <strong>prop</strong> to display the <strong>Parent's state</strong>.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            The second <strong>Child Component</strong> is tasked with updating / changing the <strong>state</strong> and thus the displayed information of it's <strong>Sibling Component</strong>.<br/>
                            For this, you firstly need to create an event handler in the <strong>Parent Component</strong>, which wraps the <strong>this.setState()</strong> function.<br/>
                            Then the created event handler gets passed to the <strong>Child</strong> as a <strong>prop</strong>. Here, you create another function, which uses and executes the <strong>prop</strong>.<br/>
                            Lastly, you use the created function in the <strong>Child Component</strong> as an event handler. <br/>
                            Now, if you execute said action, the <strong>Parent's state</strong> gets updated and sends the new <strong>state</strong> to the second <strong>Child</strong> to be displayed.
