                    <div class="content">
                        <p> CSS works with selectors, which work with "priorities". <br />
                            The first selector refers to HTML tags. For example to style a &lt;div&gt; you type 'div {}'' into the CSS file.<br />
                            The second selectors selects classes in your HTML file. To style &lt;div class="test"&gt; you type '.test {}' into your CSS file.<br />
                            The final selector selects your HTML objects by ID. If you'd like to style &lt;div id="testid"&gt; you need to add '#testid {}' into your CSS file.<br />
                            The priority of the selectors is HTML Tag &lt; Class &lt; ID. <br>A declaration in an ID selector overrides a declaration in a class selector. 
                            Both override declarations of Tag selectors.

                        <p>
                            The property <strong>background-color</strong> sets the color of the background, while <strong>color</strong> sets the the text-color.<br>
                            With <strong>background-image</strong> you can set the background of an element to an image.<br>
                            <br>
                            With <strong>font-family</strong>, you define the typeface of an element. <br>
                            <strong>Font-size</strong> and <strong>font-weight</strong> control the size of and how thin or thick the displayed text is.<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Opacity</strong> can make an element transparent.<br>
                            <br>
                            The <strong>line-height</strong> property modifies the vertical spacing between lines of text.<br>
                            The <strong>letter-spacing</strong> property changes how far apart individual letters are.<br>
                            The <strong>text-align</strong> property places text in the left, right, or center of its parent container.<br>
                            The <strong>word-spacing</strong> property changes how far apart individual words are.

                        <p>
                            The position of an element can be modified with the <strong>position</strong> property.<br>
                            When set to <strong>relative</strong>, an element's position is relative to its default position on the page.<br>
                            When set to <strong>absolute</strong>, an element's position is relative to its closest positioned parent element.<br>
                            It can be pinned to any part of the web page, but the element will still move with the rest of the document when the page is scrolled.<br>
                            When set to <strong>fixed</strong>, an element's position can be pinned to any part of the web page. The element will remain in view no matter what.<br>
                            When set to <strong>sticky</strong>, an element can stick to a defined offset position when the user scrolls its parent container.<br>
                            <br>
                            The <strong>z-index</strong> of an element specifies how far back or how far forward an element appears on the page when it overlaps other elements.<br>
                            <br>
                            The <strong>display</strong> property allows you to control how an element flows vertically and horizontally in a document.<br>
                            When set to <strong>inline</strong>, elements take up as little space as possible, and they cannot have manually adjusted width or height.<br>
                            When set to <strong>block</strong>, elements take up the width of their container and can have manually adjusted heights.<br>
                            When set to <strong>inline-block</strong>, elements can have set width and height, but they can also appear next to each other and do not take up their entire container width.<br>
                            <br>
                            The <strong>float</strong> property moves elements as far left or right as possible on a web page.<br>
                            <br>
                            The <strong>clear</strong> property clears the left or right side (or both) of an element.<br>

                        <p>
                            With the <strong>cursor</strong> property, you can set the cursor to e. g. 'Pointer'.<br>
                            <br>
                            In addition to styling elements themselves, other signifiers and visual feedback can be utilized during user interaction.<br>
                            For this, the pseudo-classes <strong>:link</strong>, <strong>:visited</strong>, <strong>:hover</strong> and <strong>:active</strong> can be used.<br>
                            <strong>:link</strong> basically has the same meaning as the selector without this pseudo-class. <br>
                            <strong>:visited</strong> styles the link after it already has been clicked. <br>
                            <strong>:hover</strong> adjusts the style while the mouse is hovering over the element in question. <br>
                            <strong>:active</strong> adjusts the style while the element is active, e. g. being clicked.<br>
                            The ordering of link state pseudo-class rules is important to reveal the proper information.

                            By adding breadcrumb navigation to a site, users can get a quick feel for where they are on a site. It also hints at the breadth of the site.<br>
                            Breadcrumbs are usually displayed as a horizontal list of pages and take up minimal space.<br>
                            Users expect to find them in the header, left-aligned, and below any primary navigation. Typically they are separated with a '>' or a '/' symbol.<br>
                            <br>
                            Through some tricks with ::before and ::after, you can e. g. design your breadcrumbs as arrows.

                    <h3 class="article_title">Layout with Flexbox</h3>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            There are two important components to a flexbox layout: flex containers and flex items.<br> 
                            A flex container is an element on a page that contains flex items. All direct child elements of a flex container are flex items.<br> 
                            This distinction is important because some of the properties apply to flex containers while others apply to flex items.<br>
                            <br>
                            The following properties can all be set on a flex-container:<br>
                            When the <strong>display</strong> property is set to 'flex', it changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it.<br>
                            When the <strong>display</strong> property is set to 'inline-flex', it allows multiple flex containers to appear inline with each other.<br>
                            The <strong>justify-content</strong> property is used to space items along the main axis (mostly left to right).<br>
                            The <strong>align-items</strong> property is used to space items along the cross axis (mostly top to bottom).<br>
                            The <strong>flex-wrap</strong> specifies that elements should shift along the cross axis if the flex container is not large enough.<br>
                            The <strong>align-content</strong> property is used to space rows along the cross axis.<br>
                            The <strong>flex-direction</strong> property is used to specify the main and cross axes.<br>
                            The <strong>flex-flow</strong> property is used to specify flex-wrap and flex-direction in one declaration.<br>
                            <br>
                            The following properties can all be set on a flex-item:<br>
                            The <strong>flex-grow</strong> property is used to specify how much space (and in what proportions) flex items absorb along the main axis.<br>
                            The <strong>flex-shrink</strong> property is used to specify how much flex items shrink and in what proportions along the main axis.<br>
                            The <strong>flex-basis</strong> property is used to specify the initial size of an element styled with flex-grow and/or flex-shrink.<br>
                            The <strong>flex</strong> property is used to specify flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis in one declaration.

                            CSS Grid can be used to layout entire web pages. <br>
                            Whereas Flexbox is mostly useful for positioning items in a one-dimensional layout, CSS grid is most useful for two-dimensional layouts, <br>
                            providing many tools for aligning and moving elements across both rows and columns.<br>
                            <br>
                            The following properties can all be set on a grid-container:<br>
                            The <strong>grid-template-columns</strong> property defines the number and sizes of the columns of the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-template-rows</strong> property defines the number and sizes of the rows of the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-template</strong> property  is a shorthand for defining both grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns in one line. Format: rows / columns.<br>
                            The <strong>row-gap</strong> property puts blank space between the rows of the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>column-gap</strong> property puts blank space between the columns of the grid.<br><br>
                            The <strong>gap</strong> property is a shorthand for defining both row-gap and column-gap in one line. Format: row-gap column-gap.<br>
                            <br>
                            The following properties can all be set on a grid-item:<br>
                            The <strong>grid-row-start</strong> and <strong>grid-row-end</strong> properties make elements span certain rows of the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-column-start</strong> and <strong>grid-column-end</strong> properties make elements span certain columns of the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-area</strong> property is a shorthand for grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, and grid-column-end in one line. Format: row-start / column-start / row-end / column-end.

                            There are following additional properties that you can use to harness the power of CSS Grid Layout:<br>
                            <br>
                            The following properties can all be set on a grid-container:<br>
                            The <strong>grid-template-areas</strong> property specifies grid named grid areas.<br>
                            The <strong>justify-items</strong> property specifies how grid-items should spread inside their column from left to right.<br>
                            The <strong>justify-content</strong> property specifies how the columns should spread inside their container from left to right.<br>
                            The <strong>align-items</strong> property specifies how grid-items should spread inside their row from top to bottom.<br>
                            The <strong>align-content</strong> property specifies how the rows should spread inside their container from top to bottom.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-auto-rows</strong> property specifies the height of rows added implicitly to the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-auto-columns</strong> property specifies the width of columns added implicitly to the grid.<br>
                            The <strong>grid-auto-flow</strong> property specifies in which direction implicit elements should be created.<br>
                            <br>
                            The following properties can all be set on a flex-item:<br>
                            The <strong>justify-self</strong> property specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the row axis and overrides justify-items.<br>
                            The <strong>align-self</strong> property specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the column axis and overrides align-items.

                            Incorporating relative sizing starts by using units other than pixels. Following properties can be used:<br>
                            <br>
                            The <strong>em</strong> property represents the font-size of the elements relative to the font-size of the parent element.<br>
                            The <strong>rem</strong> property represents the font-size of the elements relative to the font-size of the root element.<br>
                            The <strong>min-width</strong> property ensures a minimum width for an element.<br>
                            The <strong>max-width</strong> property ensures a maximum width for an element.<br>
                            The <strong>min-height</strong> property ensures a minimum height for an element.<br>
                            The <strong>max-height</strong> property ensures a maximum height for an element.<br>

                            To responsivly scale videos and images, the following properties can be used:<br>
                            The <strong>overflow</strong> property with value <strong>hidden</strong> defines that media will be cut, if it's larger than its container.<br>
                            To then adjust the media to the container, you should set <strong>max-width</strong> to <strong>100%</strong>, <strong>height</strong> to <strong>auto</strong> and <strong>display</strong> to <strong>block</strong>.
